Project: manager of google calendar

Google calendar is very useful and cool.
But I want to see some paticular paticular schedule in the list and get good suggestion related to the schedule etc..

To tell the truth,I'm interested in the application which a github user tries to make,and I want to make alike application!

I will be very happy if I could use algorithm and method ,such as GA and Gradient Descnet, that are my lab research themes in this program.
